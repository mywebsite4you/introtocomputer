        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <p>
            Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case, central processing unit (CPU), monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard. By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware.

        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>
            Your system has three basic types of software: application programs, device drivers, and operating systems. Each type of software performs a completely different job, but all three work closely together to perform useful work.
